# Diabetes Prediction System 🩺

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical attributes.

## 🔍 Features Used:
- Age
- BMI
- Blood Pressure
- Blood Serum Levels (S1 to S6)

## 🧠 ML Workflow:
1. Load dataset
2. Preprocess and convert target to binary
3. Train-test split
4. Train Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate accuracy
6. Predict new data

## 📊 Accuracy:
Achieved ~75% accuracy using logistic regression on the modified diabetes dataset.

## 👨‍💻 Built With:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
